E1.2 Does a system-wide config file control the behavior of the man command at your site? What lines
would you add to this file if you wanted to store local material in /doc/man? What directory structure
would you have to use in /doc/man to make it a full citizen of the man page hierachy?
ANSWER The /private/etc/man.conf is default system-wide config file.
